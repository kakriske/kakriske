### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Kyle, a full-stack developer. With a curious mind and a background in physics, I love unraveling how things work. Web development caught my attention as a field where logic meets creativity, and I'm on a journey to explore all its facets. 

Languages & Frameworks: JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, CSS, HTML, TypeScript
